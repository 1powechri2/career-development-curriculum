Why is talking about these things a focus at Turing? To answer that, let's look to our mission:


You're here because you want to pursue a new career that you're passionate about, and we want to not only help you do that, but to do that successfully...

Discuss objectives (above)

### Overview of Strengths & Working Styles

Scenario:    How does this person work best?

How can they work together better?

Scenario: How can this person work better in X way?

#### Pairin Survey 
If you're having trouble answering the above questions, the Pairin survey might be able to help you. Pairin is a tool that gives you insight into 102 **coachable** and **changeable** professional skills ranging from citizenship to empathy to self awareness. The results from your survey will help you to identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth. 

##### Taking the Survey
* You'll take the survey twice; once at the beginning of Module 1 and once at the end of Module 4, which will show progress that you've made during your time at Turing
* The survey will measure both **how you are** and **how you want to be.** Make sure to take the second "optional" part of the survey, answering in terms of *how you want to be* in order to see the comparison.

### Overview of Top 4 Qualities
Your results show you top 4 qualities:

1. Top General Style 
2. Most Intense Driver
3. Highest EQ Competency
4. Leading Virtue Class

#### General Styles 
The General Styles are composed of 6 global attributes that sum up an individual’s characteristic manner of behavior and describe one’s overall approach to life. These are:

* Assertiveness: Bold Communicator 
* Compliance: Accommodator 
* Dynamism: Dynamo 
* Individuality: Free Thinker 
* Sociability: Encourager 
* Well-Being: Ocean of Calm 

Questions for the group:
* How are each of these strengths? What would they look like in action?

#### Drivers 
Psychologist Henry Murray outlined a set of psychological needs that—-alone or in combination—-drive specific behaviors. Murray believed that everyone has the same set of needs but that individuals experience them in different intensities. These Drivers are based on Murray’s needs. The three domains (Love, Work & Growth) are derived from the core concepts of Abraham Maslow, Edgar Schein and James Sales. 

* **Love** — *to interact, connect with &  experience care for and from others*
   * Relationship: Friend 
   * Supportiveness: Caregiver 
   * Flamboyance: Stand-out 
   * Deference: Loyalist
   * Support-Seeking: Reliant

* **Work** — *to influence outcomes & gain mastery*
   * Achievement: Ace Achiever 
   * Personal Power: Director 
   * Persistence: Tug Boat 
   * Order: Specialist 
   * Aggressiveness: Blaze 

* **Growth** — *to be all that I can be in life; fulfilled purpose & potential*
   * Change: Transformer 
   * Independence: Maverick 
   * Perceptivity: Searcher 
   * Vitality: Enthusiast 
   * Self-Blame: Microscope 

#### Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Competencies 
The definition of Emotional Intelligence or EQ (first advanced by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer, but popularized by author Daniel Goleman) is the ability to:
Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions
Recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others
In practical terms, developing EQ means gaining awareness that emotions drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively), and learning to manage those emotions — both our own and others — especially when we are under pressure. The EQ framework has four categories comprising 18 competencies as outlined below.

Self-Awareness 
Emotional Self-Awareness: 	Self-Attuned
Self-Assessment: 		Self-Examiner 
Self-Confidence: 		Self-Confident

Self-Management 
Self-Control: 			Calm, Cool, Collected 
Transparency: 			Glass Window 
Achievement: 			Ace Achiever
Initiative: 			Self-Starter 
Optimism:			Can Do Attitude 
Flexibility & Adaptability: 	Elasticity

Social Awareness 
Empathy: 			I “Get” You 
Organizational Awareness: 	Group Expert 
Service Orientation: 		At Your Service 

Relationship Management  
Inspirational Leader: 		Inspirational Leader 
Influential Leader: 		Influential Leader
Enriching Others: 		People Developer 
Change:			Transformer 
Conflict Management: 		Conflict Wrangler 
Cooperative-Practical: 		Team Player 

#### Virtue Classes
Six broad virtues classifying twenty-four specific strengths that consistently emerge as “good” across history and culture. PAIRIN’s virtues map to Character Strengths and Virtues (Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P., 2004), the work of a prestigious group of researchers who have attempted to create a systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. Their aim was to present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical and scientific way.  

 Knowing your leading virtue class and associated strengths isn’t just interesting information. Research shows that tapping into character strengths can help an individual to: 1) Buffer against, manage and overcome problems, 2) Improve relationships, and 3) Enhance health and overall well-being.
