### Overview of Professional Development at Turing
Turing’s **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. 

Turing’s career development curriculum is created directly out of this mission with a focus on **unlocking students’ potential** in modules 1 and 2 through cultivating self-awareness and empathy. In modules 3 and 4, curriculum focuses on providing strategies to empower students to **succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers** by creating connections within the technology industry, building competencies for industry leadership, and securing a fulfilling career -- and not just another job. 

The touchstones of this curriculum include these mindsets: 

* **Agency:** Taking initiative and ownership over your learning and work
* **Empathy:** Understanding and sharing others' emotions in order to relate to them 
* **Engagement:** Active participation in community
* **Grit:** A combination of perseverance and passion
* **Growth:** A belief that your abilities can be developed through dedication, hard work, and resiliency

From this, we aim for students to develop a **self-awareness** that allows them to speak to their strengths and build connections with developers and others in this industry.

**Individual Reflections:** To start our discussion today, we need to reflect on where we are right now and then start to think about where we want to go. In your journals, answer the following questions in **1 sentence each:**

* What is your greatest strength and how do you know?
* How do you work best?
* What is your greatest area of improvement?

The results from your survey will help you to identify some of your strengths and potential areas for growth.

### Overview of Top 4 Qualities
Your results show you top 4 qualities:

1. Top General Style 
2. Most Intense Driver
3. Highest EQ Competency

#### General Styles

* Assertiveness: Bold Communicator 
* Compliance: Accommodator 
* Dynamism: Dynamo 
* Individuality: Free Thinker 
* Sociability: Encourager 
* Well-Being: Ocean of Calm 

Questions for the group:

#### Drivers 
Psychologist Henry Murray outlined a set of psychological needs that—-alone or in combination—-drive specific behaviors. Murray believed that everyone has the same set of needs but that individuals experience them in different intensities. These Drivers are based on Murray’s needs. The three domains (Love, Work & Growth) are derived from the core concepts of Abraham Maslow, Edgar Schein and James Sales. 

* **Love** — *to interact, connect with &  experience care for and from others*
   * Relationship: Friend 
   * Supportiveness: Caregiver 
   * Flamboyance: Stand-out

#### Emotional Intelligence (EQ) Competencies 
The definition of Emotional Intelligence or EQ (first advanced by researchers Peter Salavoy and John Mayer, but popularized by author Daniel Goleman) is the ability to:
Recognize, understand and manage our own emotions
Recognize, understand and influence the emotions of others
In practical terms, developing EQ means gaining awareness that emotions drive our behavior and impact people (positively and negatively), and learning to manage those emotions — both our own and others — especially when we are under pressure. The EQ framework has four categories comprising 18 competencies as outlined below.

Self-Awareness 
Emotional Self-Awareness: 	Self-Attuned
Self-Assessment: 		Self-Examiner 
Self-Confidence: 		Self-Confident

Self-Management 
Self-Control: 			Calm, Cool, Collected 
Transparency: 			Glass Window 
Achievement: 			Ace Achiever
Initiative: 			Self-Starter 
Optimism:			Can Do Attitude 
Flexibility & Adaptability: 	Elasticity

Social Awareness 
Empathy: 			I “Get” You 
Organizational Awareness: 	Group Expert 
Service Orientation: 		At Your Service 

Relationship Management  
Inspirational Leader: 		Inspirational Leader 
Influential Leader: 		Influential Leader
Enriching Others: 		People Developer 
Change:			Transformer 
Conflict Management: 		Conflict Wrangler 
Cooperative-Practical: 		Team Player 

#### Virtue Classes
Six broad virtues classifying twenty-four specific strengths that consistently emerge as “good” across history and culture. PAIRIN’s virtues map to Character Strengths and Virtues (Peterson, C., & Seligman, M. E. P., 2004), the work of a prestigious group of researchers who have attempted to create a systematic classification and measurement of widely valued positive traits. Their aim was to present a measure of humanist ideals of virtue in an empirical and scientific way.  

 Knowing your leading virtue class and associated strengths isn’t just interesting information. Research shows that tapping into character strengths can help an individual to: 1) Buffer against, manage and overcome problems, 2) Improve relationships, and 3) Enhance health and overall well-being.
