### Opening
You have started to work together in meaningful ways--during class, in pairing sessions, and in partner projects.  That means that we are 100% certain you are about to experience (or already have) a clash in working styles.  If we can discuss how we learn and work best, we can think about ways that we can better communicate our needs AND compromise in order to bring out the best in everyone.  Today we are going to start with a quick growth mindset reflection and then dig into understanding the spectrum of workstyles we have in our cohorts. 

#### Objectives

* Build self-awareness so that you can develop even more empathy with others
* Understand how we can leverage our different working styles for success at Turing and beyond

#### What Do Introversion and Extroversion Mean, Really? 
What comes to mind when you hear the word "introvert"? What comes to mind when you hear the word "extrovert"? 

Read the following [article](https://www.fastcompany.com/3016031/leadership-now/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert-and-what-it-means-for-your-career) to get a better sense of what these terms mean.

Often we think that introverts are shy and extroverts are outgoing. But really, everyone exists on the spectrum of introversion and extroversion, and 


### Working Styles & Preferences
On the imaginary line presented by your Facilitator, think about where you fall in the spectrum of introversion and extroversion while at Turing. Many times you can say that your intro/extro/ambiversion might depend on the situation.  In this case, we want you to select the place on the spectrum that you are most often in while you are at Turing.  Think about your reactions in class, how you respond to pairing, how you work in group projects.  


### Small Group Discussion #1 
With 2-3 people who are standing near you on the line, form a group and grab a piece of chart paper to answer the following questions:

* What are your strengths in regards to this working style?
* What challenges have you faced because you identify with this working style? Think about challenges in pairing, in class, in community activities.
* How do you think you're perceived by those who don't share this same working style?
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?

### Gallery Walk

Students walk around the room to read what's been written on the various charts. They should note any new ideas or perspectives they want to remember. 

### Small Group Discussion #2


In your new groups, discuss these questions. Everyone should have a chance to share without interruption.  

* Share your dominant working style and what came up in your first discussion
* What do you need from other working styles to be at your best?
* What are some of the differences between working styles that cause conflict?
* How could you address the differences in your work?

## Whole Group Share 
What have you learned about your own style today? What have you learned about the opposing style? 

### Individual Reflection
In your notebook, please respond to these two questions.

* What did you hear from people who were opposite ends of the spectrum from you?  What would it require for you to give someone else what they needed to be at their best? 
* How can you leverage your place on the spectrum of introversion/extroversion to impact your career in the future?

### Closing
Make sure to share your reflections with your partner in your paired project this week.
