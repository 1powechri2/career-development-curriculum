#### The Why: Why Telling Your Story is Important
Stories are how we connect with each other. From fairy tales to novels to movies to podcasts, stories provide a way for people to share their experiences with others, building empathy and awareness of our universal experiences.

Storytelling is our first step in the job search at Turing. You are a member of the software industry now, and as you start connecting with others in the industry, you need to be able to tell the story of your transition -- how did you get here? How do you uniquely make up a part of this industry? 

In this session and throughout your career development at Turing, we'll focus on how you can craft a compelling story to describe who you are, how you came to this industry, and where you see yourself going. This is a story that you'll tell employers, colleagues at networking events, and even your Turing community. This is the start of you being able to tell your story professionally and find the right match for your future career.

Let's start by thinking about stories. What do you love about stories? Emma Coats, a former story artist for Pixar, published [this post](http://storyshots.tumblr.com/post/25032057278/22-storybasics-ive-picked-up-in-my-time-at-pixar) with her 22 rules for storytelling. We're going to start with rule #10:

    Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; 
    you’ve got to recognize it before you can use it.

**Turn & Talk:**

What stories stick with you and why? Think of a story that you love; maybe it's a story from childhood, maybe it's a book you just finished reading, or maybe it's a story that has been passed down through your family. Turn to the person next to you and take 2 minutes to retell that story, and then switch.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

Sharing from 1-2 people:

* What key details do you remember from your partner's story?
* How did your partner tell the story? 
* What made the story interesting?

This brings us to the elements that make up a good story -- what are they?

Possible answers: consistent theme, protagonist who faces and overcomes challenges, a journey of some kind, sequential plot that shows a beginning, middle, and end.

When it comes to character, what does it mean to be the hero of the story? What are the typical characteristics of a hero? 

**More Lessons from Pixar (and Joseph Campbell):**
Most stories follow the 3-Act Arc:
* Act I (Set-Up)
   * Call to adventure and accepts
   * Rules of the world are established
   * Inciting Incident
* Act II (Struggle)
   * Looking for ways to solve the problem
   * Learning what it will take to actually solve problem
   * Crisis/“Lowest of the low”
* Act III (Finale)
   * Show what’s been learned
   * Protagonist is changed

**Connection to You:**
These elements are present in your story as well. You are the main character, the hero, undergoing challenges, experiencing a journey, and revealing the narrative thread through your own theme.

There are 3 main questions to help us understand our own stories and our character arcs:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here?
* What's next?

### Discussion #1: Stories from Staff
More rules from Emma Coats:

    What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don’t succeed? Stack the odds against them.
    
    You admire a character for trying more than for their successes.

This is because we root for a character to overcome struggles and adversity. As the character in our own stories, we need to be able to access our vulnerabilities to authentically tell this part of our story -- *and our listeners will thank us for it because this is how they relate to us.* 

Let's here from some Turing staff on this aspect of their stories:

* Jeff's story: 
      
      I remember really struggling when I first started learning about functional programming. At that point I had been 
      writing code for 15 years. I started to see that the anxiety about not "getting it" was actually preventing me from 
      getting it. When I don't understand what I'm doing I like to copy, modify, create. I take something that I know works, 
      from the web or a book or whatever, and just type that out and make it run. Then I start tweaking things. What if I 
      rearrange two lines, change some numbers or values, that kind of thing. I think of it as "pulling on" the code, seeing 
      how it flexes and changes. Then I delete a chunk of the code and try to write it myself.
      
      I think one of my strengths in life and programming is a willingness to experiment. I prefer to move quickly and learn, even if it means making mistakes, rather than sitting and planning. When you're planning you're working with the information you have right now. When you experiment you have the opportunity to gain new perspective/data.

* Ian's story:

      Even as a kid I always loved to teach other people things I knew. In high school, I tried to teach a friend how to play piano. In college, I tutored math and programming. After graduation, everything I ever learned about coding I would find someone to teach what I'd just taught. I've been very driven with a desire to help people grow and helping with programming ideas has been extremely fulfilling.

      I'm a big fan of Linux, especially the Ubuntu ("uh-BOON-too") distribution. "Ubuntu" is part of a South African phrase about humanity that means "I am what I am because of who we all are." From that, I formed my own catchphrase to encourage sharing knowledge with one another: "Share what you know, we all win." Sharing knowledge is not a zero-sum game (where only one person has all the things in the end); it's a community-driven idea that exists back throughout all of human history of bettering ourselves through shared experiences.

* Victoria's story: 
    
      I view the world through the lens of growing up in a lower-middle-class children-of-immigrants family (my parents' 
      parents' all fled Lithuania during World War II). Sometimes my parents would speak Lithuanian to keep us from hearing &
      I rarely spoke with my grandparents because they spoke mostly Lithuanian. My father's company was based in Lithuania and
      they got repeatedly downsized until it was only that branch left & he chose to move back there around 1990 and has lived
      in Vilnius ever since. My siblings and I grew up fairly religious and all that history, combined with my natural
      inclination to be introverted, made me very quiet, reserved and well-behaved kid. When I grew to understand many things
      that upset me about my religion and religion in general, I began to question everything and this sparked a highly
      curious and fairly rebellious stage of my life. I explored many different realms of work and various passions, and
      especially loved to challenge norms by taking on roles normally held by males. That led to being a nomadic farmer and
      cab driver for 5 years. The farming work-trades, apprenticeships, & jobs were the most unique and eye-opening
      experiences of my life, but ironically none of it was financially sustainable for me in the long-run. The cab life also
      became draining, risky, and isolating. So I decided I wanted a decent day job that could offer me a means to pay off my
      debts and eventually sponsor interesting opportunities for friends and loved ones. I really hope to eventually implement
      my newly-gained developer skills in tools for farmers, games for scientific education and resources to enhance political
      memory.

**Discussion Questions:**
* What are the “acts” that you can see in this story?
* What did you learn about this person? How would you describe their character?
* What elements are present in this story? 
* How could this story be used to connect with others when building personal and professional relationships?

### Pomodoro Break

### Choose Your Own Adventure: Developing Your Story
Using one (or more) of these storytelling tools, begin crafting your story:
* Life maps
* Story plot diagrams
* Vision statement
* Character study of yourself using StrengthsFinder

### Discussion #2 
Get into new groups of 4 to share your stories. Practice answering these questions:
* Who are you?
   * What is your journey/perspective/character?
* Why are you here? 
   * How are you learning and growing through the struggle?
* What’s next?
   * What’s your place in the tech industry?

*Share only what you’re comfortable sharing* 

### Closing: Whole Group Takeaways

* By sharing our stories with one another, how can we as a community build on our similarities and learn from our differences?
* What are particularly easy or difficult about sharing your stories with each other?
* How can talking about these 3 areas (who are we, why are we here, what's next) help us in our future careers? 

#### Next Steps
It's important to remember that each of these pieces of your story is a draft. You're continuing to grow and learn, and thus your story will change. But this is about starting with our first draft and getting better at refining it as we go through the program. 

**Right Now:** Finish your [reflection](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/storytelling_reflection.md) using what you worked on in this session for your deliverable due Monday of Week 6. 

**Looking Ahead:** 
* Module Two: Dive more deeply into your *professional* story
* Module Three: Tell your story through resumes, cover letters, and the Turing portfolio
* Module Four: Tell your Turing story through an end-of-Turing presentation for a panel

During the rest of your time here, consider ways that you can share your stories, the things that you value, and what you are hoping for in the upcoming weeks. The more connections you can make, the better you will be able to work together towards success.
