### Opening
#### Objectives & Why:
Objectives of our session today:
* Understand what a retro is and what it can look like in practice
* Build on your feedback process by using the Nonviolent Communication Framework to increase the mindfulness in your communication
* Execute a successful retro in your project groups

Why are we talking about retros?
* This is a part of the agile process
* This is how you continue to build strong communication skills
* Strong communication leads to better software

#### Reminder: Deliverable
Submit a reflection on using agile and participating in retro feedback using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_feedback_reflection_guidelines.md) in survey provided by 9am on Friday of Week 5

#### Reflection (2 mins)
Take 90 seconds to reflect on the role you've taken in your project so far in terms of how you're using your strengths and leadership style. Reminder about the four domains:

* **Executing:** Team members who have a dominant strength in Executing are those you turn to time and again to implement a solution. These people work tirelessly to get something done. People who are strong in the Executing domain have an ability to take an idea and transform it into a reality within the organization they lead
* **Influencing:** People who are innately good at influencing are always selling the team’s ideas inside and outside the organization. When you need someone to take charge, speak up, and make sure your group is heard, look to someone with Influence.
* **Relationship Building:** Relationship Builders are the glue that holds a team together. Strengths associated with bringing people together -- whether it is by keeping distractions at bay or keeping the collective energy high -- transform a group of individuals into a team capable of carrying out complex projects and goals.
* **Strategic Thinking:** Those who are able to keep people focused on “what they could” be are constantly pulling a team and its members into the future. They continually absorb and analyze information and help the team make better decisions.

### Overview of Team Retros 

  * Setting norms for the discussion (maybe have this take the place of the template?)
    * "opening" -- revisit Tuckman's; where are we in the group dynamic cycle? 
    * process ("body")
    * next steps ("closing")
    * A little on sources of interest -- what are you bringing to the conversation? What do you hope to get out of the conversation?
  * What went well? Appreciation feedback! Be specific!
  * What needs improvement? Coaching; About actions and outcomes, not specific people
  * What are the next steps? 

#### What is a Retrospective?
Notes from [Do's and Don't's: How to Conduct Effective Retros](https://www.inloox.com/company/blog/articles/do-s-and-don-ts-how-to-conduct-effective-retrospectives/):
* It's a meeting that happens at the end of a scrum sprint/iteration and at the end of a project. *This is part of agile processes*
* This meeting is an opportunity for the project team to look back at what they have achieved during the last sprint, what went really well, and what could be improved. 
* **The focus is not on how the product or deliverable could be improved but on how the team can collaborate more effectively to generate better outcomes.** 
* Retrospectives are great for helping teams understand each other better and facilitate better collaboration which in turn leads to improved productivity. *The emphasis is on continuous improvement and change, instead of blindly following the same old procedures and processes.*

#### Tools for Retros
Today we're going to use chart paper and post-its to outline our retros, but

### How to Communicate More Mindfully: Nonviolent Communication Framework
In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the [Nonviolent Communication Framework](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/freeresources/article_archive/heartofnvc_mrosenberg.htm) in order to use our natural *compassion* when communicating with each other.

Similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) in Module One, the Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more *mindful* in your communication with others.

* **Whole Group:** What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like? When is communication *not* mindful?

Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet. We often spend our time communicating:

 * Blame (i.e. "this is your fault")
 * Insults ( i.e. "you're a jerk")
 * Labels (i.e. "you're not a big picture person")
 * Criticism (i.e. "you're bad at JavaScript")
 * Comparisons (i.e. "no one else in the cohort has this problem")
 * Diagnoses (i.e. you have a hard time thinking problems all the way through") -- Note: this is a big one!

Nonviolent Communication instead integrates:
* Consciousness: empathy and awareness
* Language: to either create connection or distance
* Communication: knowing to how to ask and how to listen
* Means of Influence: sharing "power" rather than using "power"

NVC Framework follows these steps:

* Observations: Facts without judgments
* Feelings: Harder than it sounds; if you find yourself using "that," "like," or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling
* Needs: You can't figure out what you need until you reflect on your feelings; use positive language and make needs clear
* Requests: Express clearly and ask for a reflection

All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have the feedback conversation to clarify your points.

#### Turn & Talk UPDATE EXAMPLES
Find a partner to discuss the following scenarios and come up with an alternative way of phrasing these pieces of feedback:

**Scenario #1: "You should have more confidence."**

**Scenario #2: "I feel inadequate because when I've brought up ideas you haven't been willing to try any of them out today."**

**Scenario #3: "I feel you are not giving 100% to this.”**

For each of the above, discuss:

* What alternatives could you use for these? 
* What could be a blind spot here? Tone of voice -- you don’t want to come across as passive aggressive
* How can you align intent and impact?

### Activity: Team Retros
Choose a format to run your retro and grab a chart paper (or 2) and copious post-its! You have 20 minutes to retro in your team. Remember to end with actionable next steps for your team to take.

### Debrief/Closing
2-3 groups share out their takeaways from the retro:
* What next steps are you focused on in your project? How did you decide on those steps?

Reminder about deliverable:
* Submit a reflection on using agile and participating in retro feedback using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_feedback_reflection_guidelines.md) in survey provided by 9am on Friday of Week 5
