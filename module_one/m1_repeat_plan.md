# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module One
Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. Mod 1 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:

### Sessions
You **are not required** to attend professional development sessions *that you have previously attended.* You can choose to come to sessions if you feel that you would benefit from the information. Sessions you have already attended are:
   * Week 1: [Building a Foundation for your Career Development](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/building_a_foundation.md) *This session combines information on strengths, working styles, and how to focus on professional growth*
   * Week 2: [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) 
   * Week 3: [Feedback I](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/feedback_i.md) 
   * Week 5: [Storytelling I](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/storytelling_i.md)

You **are required** to attend new PD sessions and all Gear Up sessions. These sessions are:
  * PD: Week 4: 
    * Monday: [Agile Practices & Leadership](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/agile_practices_and_leadership.md)

  * Gear Up:
    * Week 1: Health & Wellness
    * Week 3: Social Justice 101
    * Week 5: Racial Caucusing
    
### Deliverables
* You **are required** to:
   * Take the Pairin survey
   * Participate in DTR and in crafting a DTR memo with your paired project partner
   * Submit feedback for your paired project partner
   * Submit a reflection on how you've used agile practices and incorporated feedback from the sessions in Week 4
   * Participate in a team project retro

* Options for additional deliverables (choose **at least 1** that you will complete during the module):
   * Identify an area of growth for yourself this module. Examples: organization, project management, time management, stress management, communication, etc. Create a goal for how you would like to improve this area and outline action steps to take. You can also discuss any of these areas with Allison if you would like to set up a 1:1 coaching session.
   * Brainstorm a way you will contribute to helping your cohort build community and describe steps you will take to build to see it through. Examples: organize a study group, lead a review session for the class, assist your SAB reps (if you are not one) in facilitating your cohort retros, organize a non-coding social activity, etc.
   * Write a blog post about something you've learned
   * Attend a Meetup *(be specific on which meetup in your plan below)*
   * Give an additional Lightning Talk, either at Wrap Up or during non-class time for your cohort
   * Other: propose another professional development action step that you will take during your repeat module

**Directions:** Write your answers to the questions below in a secret gist that you'll submit to Allison. 

1. Are you going to attend any PD sessions that you attended last module? If so, which ones? List below.

2. In addition to meeting the required deliverables, which option will you choose to work on this mod to further your professional development?

3. How will you know at the end of this module that you have successfully completed your professional development goals?
