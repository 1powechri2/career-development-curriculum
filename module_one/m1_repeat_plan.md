# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module One

### Instructions & Expectations for Structuring the Module
Using the guidelines below, create a plan for your professional development during your Mod 1 repeat based on:

1. Any requirements that you still need to meet 
2. Areas you've identified in which you'd like to grow for your professional and personal development
3. Areas in which you can demonstrate leadership and mentor your fellow cohortmates

In order to fulfill those criteria, you need decide on an option to meet each of the listed deliverables and outline which sessions you will attend and how you plan to participate in order to build your skills in these areas. Please outline your plan in a secret gist, which you'll submit to Allison. 

#### Professional Development
Mod 1 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Cultivate Self-Awareness
* Understand one's key strengths
* Know how to learn, including how to learn through struggle
* Ownership over one's learning
* Communicate effectively with partners through the entire pairing process from setting expectations to giving feedback
* Express one's own story and strengths
* Manage stress effectively

As you make your plan, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

| Week       | Sessions           | Focus  | Deliverable(s) | Repeating Requirements | Additional Options *(as this suggests, it's optional if you've already fulfilled module requirements)* 	|

| 1      | [StrengthsFinder](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/intro_strengthsfinder_session.md) | Identifying strengths & areas of growth | Optional reflection using [this template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/strengths_reflection_guidelines.md) | Put your SF themes in the new cohort spreadsheet | Consider how you want to continue building your strengths and your awareness around your strengths. Suggestions:
1. Take one of your top SF strengths and create a goal for how you will further develop it this module, using concrete action steps and benchmarks to measure your progress. If it's helpful, schedule a 1:1 with Allison to discuss it further!

2. Organize a group discussion around shared strengths in your cohort -- for anyone who has a strength in common with you, how can you share knowledge and resources to continue building it? |

What do you want to improve? Suggestions:  1. Do the opposite of what you did in your most recent paired project, i.e., if you were the driver, be the navigator, or vice versa. If you usually take the lead in discussing a problem, listen to your partner's ideas first. Switching up your role frequently will allow you to build different skills.  2. Push yourself to learn something new and teach it to your partner in regards to the project.   3. Based on the DTR with your partner, create a plan to help your partner with an area they identify as a weakness in the project.  	|

How do you want to do that? Suggestions:  1. Write down all your feedback for your partner in whatever words come most naturally. Then, analyze each phrase to see how you can reword it to come even closer to your intent and match with the principles of being specific, actionable, and kind before sending it in.  2. Schedule a follow-up conversation with your partner to break down the feedback in person.  Reflect on your reactions to feedback and make a plan to build that skill. Suggestions:  1. Each time you receive feedback on a project, create one concrete goal that you will work towards to improve in the skills mentioned in the feedback. Decide what next steps you will take to improve and when you hope to achieve that goal by.  2. Recognize when you're feeling triggered and make a plan for managing those emotions to help you discover the root cause underneath that triggering feeling.  	|
