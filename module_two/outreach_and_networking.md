### Deliverable
Provide a plan for how you'll utilize outreach and networking during Module Three using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_networking_guidelines.md).

### Opening
**Hook:** Who can remember something unique about someone else in this room that you'd like to share? Why do you remember that? What value could that information potentially provide you? What value can you provide to others in this room?

That's networking -- building relationships that provide mutual value. Hopefully, this takes away some of the stigma or uncomfortable feelings associated with "networking" and instead begins to help you reframe networking as nothing more than making new relationships. 

In the technology industry, even moreso than in other industries, getting ahead in your career comes down to **who you know.** Establishing strong connections with others in the technology community starts while you're at Turing and will be a focal point of your job search. 

In this session, we'll focus on how you can start building those relationships through utilizing the practices of outreach and networking. 

#### What This Looks Like
Building relationships with developers and others in the tech community might feel daunting, so start with smaller steps:

* Turing network: mentors, posses, alumni, student groups, guest speakers 
* Events: meetups and events that happen at Turing or are Turing-affiliated

Then, move onto bigger steps:
* Cold outreach -- reaching out to contacts at companies you don't already have a connection with
* Events -- attending meetups, conferences, and participating in hackathons that aren't connected to Turing
* Open Source -- contribute to projects not affiliated with Turing

Embracing outreach and networking will help you both in your initial job search after Turing and in your overall career 

### Outreach: Step by Step
#### Where to Find Connections: The Network You Already Have
Let's start with the obvious question: who can you reach out to? How will you find these new connections? You already have access to more contacts than you might first realize.

* **Dormant Ties:** These are people you know from other walks of life whom you may not have talked with in a while
   * Why you should reach out to them: You already know them. You may not have talked to them in a while, but it's not a cold contact. And chances are, you're already connected to them on social media so it's not difficult to reconnect with them. 
    * What value they bring:
         * They can introduce you to others in their network. Look at their LinkedIn connections -- do they know people you want to know? 
    * What value you bring:
         * You can introduce them to people in the Turing network or talk to them about website design, the tech industry, any number of things that you have learned while at Turing
* **Weak Ties:** As opposed to strong ties (the people you are closest to), these are people who you are not as close with. They run in different circles than you do, so they know other people to introduce you to
    * Why you should reach out to them:
         * Open yourself up to new perspectives and relationships outside of your usual circle
    * What value they bring:
         * New people and new connections
    * What value you bring:
         * The same -- since you're a weak tie to them, you also have networks and information that is new to them. You're able to share this value equally. 
* **Meetups:** These events bring together people with shared interests, which is a perfect place to start new relationships. 
     * Why you should attend these:
         * Meetups are a true mixture of people from different places in the industry -- from other new devs to seasoned programmers, you'll be able to meet people from all walks of life at a meetup to gain new perspectives and relationships
     * What value they bring:
         * A meetup's RSVP list is like a who's who of your new network. It's easy to use these to build an understanding of the people you want to connect with, and you'll end up seeing the same faces at each meetup, which makes it that much easier to capitalize on new relationships
     * What value you bring:
         * As a member of the local tech community, you bring fresh ideas and learning into a space that wants to foster just that. Consider giving a talk at a meetup -- you'll not only be able to practice your speaking skills, but you'll provide that meetup's community with a chance to learn from you. 
* **Turing Network:** 
   * Turing Mentors: If you don't already have a mentor you meet with regularly, you should find one right now. Use the [mentor database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oxsATOSIdRZ78-Bj3GQY2LkIp0OV_sCN6GJVjtUuCl0/edit?usp=sharing). 
      * Why you should reach out to them:
         * This is *warm outreach* -- they are already in our community and have signed up specifically for students to reach out to them. What are you waiting for? 
      * What value they bring:
         * Project help
         * Drills and homework help
         * Learning about the industry
         * Technical and/or behavioral prep
         * Emotional support 
         * Learning about specific jobs/companies
         * Learning about the tech scene in a certain location
      * What value you bring:
         * Provide them with the opportunity to grow their mentoring skills
   * Turing Alumni (especially any who are not in the mentorship database):
      * Why you should reach out to them:
         * They've been in your shoes. They can give you the do's and don'ts of navigating the tech industry based on their own experience as a Turing grad.
      * What value they bring: 
         * In addition to their own perspective, they bring connections from the network they've been building since they were students. See who they can introduce you to.
      * What value you bring:
         * Community. You're part of the Turing community too and you serve as a connection to the latest information in the Turing community
         
For a more in-depth perspective on the network that you already have, check out Wharton professor and author of *Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success* Adam Grant's post [Finding the Hidden Value in Your Network](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-grant/finding-the-hidden-value-_1_b_3458536.html)

#### Put the COLD in Cold Outreach
When creating a completely new relationship, here are some tips:

* Look outside of the Turing community and try to avoid companies where alums are working
* Where are alumni already working? Here is a quick list (but not exhaustive) of companies that you should skip:

8th Light, Active Network, AdHawk, Advantage Integrated, Agilion, Allstate, American Thrombosis and Hemotosis Network, Aurigae, Blue Apron, Bonobos, Brandfolder, CA Technologies, Captain U, CareZone, Cirro, Coders Workshop, Cognizant Quick Left, CustomInk, DHR.net, Democracy Works, Digital Ocean, DispatchHealth, Ello, Equal Opportunity Schools, FanDuel Inc, Gitlab, Glassbreakers, GoSpotCheck, Gramercy Tech, Granicus, Guild Education, Harry Fox Agency (aka SESAC/Rumblefish), Huron, Impekable, Influx Data, Inquicker, Inspirato, Instacart, Invoca, Kite, Muve Health, NextRequest, Optum, Oracle, Politech, Procore, Real Geeks, Rumblefish, Shopify, Splice, Stitch Fix, TEKSystems, Tack Mobile, Tendril, Trelora, United Health Group, Vermont Public Radio, Vulk Coop, Wazee Digital, WellMatch/Aetna, Welltok Inc, Western Union, Wombat Security, eGauge Systems, iCentris, iTrellis

* Do some research: what do you know about the person you're contacting? 
   * Find out where their interests lie. Read their Medium blog posts, sign up for their newsletters, and check out their websites. Some other resources:
   * Research their projects on GitHub
   * Look for community builders (events, sponsors, etc)
   * Again, use Meetup -- where do these contacts spend their time?
   * More sites for research:
      * [Built in Colorado](http://www.builtincolorado.com/companies): find more companies
      * [Slacklist](http://www.slacklist.info/) 
      * [AngelList](https://angel.co/)
      * [CrunchBase](https://www.crunchbase.com/#/home/index) 

You need to understand your contact's goals as much as you want them to know yours.

#### Finding Contact Info
Now that you know who you want to connect with, there are many tools that can help you find contact information if you don't already have it. Check out these tools:

* [Email Hunter](https://emailhunter.co/)
* [Find That Lead](https://findthatlead.com/)
* [Find That Email](https://findthat.email/)
* [MatterMark](https://mattermark.com/)
* [Skrapp.io](https://www.skrapp.io/)
* [Hunter.io](https://hunter.io/)
* [Quickmail.io](https://quickmail.io/)
* GitHub
* Personal website  

#### Crafting Your Email
**Whole Group Discussion:** When you're reaching out to people, what is your purpose? Hint: it's not to ask for a job. 

Most common purpose: Research Conversations -- what is the purpose of these conversations? How can you approach this? 

Here are some [possible questions to ask](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/research_conversation_questions.md)

With mentors:

* Set expectations for the initial meeting based on what you've identified as your biggest priorities. Your relationship will grow from there

Develop a template to use. This will help you stay on script and get to the point.

1. Use the subject line: 

    * Short and real - lose the sales pitch
    * Relevant and personal
    * Consider how the snippet extends the subject line
    
    "Life at [amazing company]" 
    OR
    "Would like to connect"
    OR 
    "Turing grad looking for advice"
    
2. Greeting (simple, not overly formal). Make sure to spell their name right: 
    
    Hello [Name],
    
3. Body: 

    *Who am I? How did I find you? What do I want?*
    
    I'm a software developer in Denver currently attending the [Name of program] at Turing School of Software & Design. I found your contact info after researching education-focused startups in Denver. I'm interested in learning more about the work going on at [Company Name] and the Colorado startup scene in general. 
    
    *What interesting experience do I have that might make me worth meeting?*
    
    Before Turing, I taught in Denver Public Schools as a third and fourth grade teacher. 
    
    *What are my goals/motives? What value do I bring? How could I potentially help you with your goals?
    
    I aim to build software that helps students learn in an intentional way. I'd love to learn more about how I can add to the kind of work that [Company] is doing. 
    
    *Call to action*
    
    Could we grab coffee or get on the phone this week? How does next Wednesday 11/1 at 4pm sound?
    
4. Closing (keep it simple):

      Thanks,
      
      [Your Name & contact info. Include your personal site if applicable]

Because you've researched your contact, you'll know if there are certain things you may have in common, such as:

* Fellow Bootcamp grad -- mention that you'd like to learn more about their transition from bootcamp to the tech industry
* Consider timing based on your research -- have they recently launched a new product? You could tie your message to events or activities that are top of mind to the recipient
* Connections -- even if you don’t know someone in common, you may have some other connection, like a school or other organization. Why did you pick that person to reach out to?

#### Other Email Tips
* Keep it casual -- no "To Whom It May Concern"
* ...But not *too* casual
* Less is more -- keep it on message, longer emails may not be read
* Double check the spelling of their name and/or their company name 
* Don't write a generic email (make sure to tailor it accordingly)
* Don't tell your life story. That can come when you actually meet the person. Keep it short, sweet, and to the point
* Utilize the subject line

### Practice & Group Feedback
Spend 10 minutes finding someone to reach out to. This could be from:

* Warm Outreach (dormant/weak ties, mentors, alumni, other Turing contacts)
* Cold Outreach (anyone in the tech industry you'd like to connect with)

Then, draft your message to them. Be sure to include:

* Subject line
* Connection
* Call to action with a specific date and time -- Suggest a few dates and times for the this week and the following; ask for 30 minutes to an hour. Offer a video hang-out as an option.

**Pair & Share:**
Find a partner and spend 5 minutes giving and receiving feedback and suggestions for improvement. You should provide:

* 1 specific piece of appreciative feedback
* 1 constructive recommendation for improvement

Reminder of guidelines for feedback conversations. Be specific, actionable, and kind! Here are examples:

* “I really like the way you circled back to the company mission!”
* “Your subject line does a great job of capturing the reader's attention!”
* “The personal connection about snowboarding was really clear!”
* "I wasn't quite sure what your connection was. Try out a few different phrases to get more specific."
* "I didn't hear a call to action. Provide a date and time to meet to make it easy for someone to respond."

“Good job buddy!” is *NOT* constructive feedback

### Follow Up
**What if they don't respond?**
If you don't receive a response, don't assume that means the conversation is dead. During busy weeks, emails can get lost. Send a follow-up email to say that you're still interested in meeting and suggest a new date/time. If you don't receive a response after that, move on to another contact.

If you receive a response saying they're too busy to meet that week or something similar, ask for a better time, and set up a meeting accordingly. Persistence pays off, and you're making it clear that meeting them is important to you. 

*YOU* should respond to emails as quickly as possible so that you can keep the conversation momentum going.

**What if they do respond?**
Use the meeting to build a relationship, *see below.* 

### Networking 101
You've reached out, now what? Let's talk about how you can build on the initial connection
   
#### Analyze Comfort Level
When it comes to networking, you'll want to consider your working style. Where do you fall on the introversion/extroversion spectrum? This will help you understand where you'll be comfortable in networking situations. 

Often, people who lean towards extroversion will be more excited about using meetups for networking and outreach opportunities because they're gaining energy from being around a lot of people and conversations. 

One-on-one coffee meetings or using social media might feel more comfortable for introverts.

Consider how *you* will feel most comfortable in creating these relationships.

#### Meetups/Events
* **Research.** As with outreach emails, you'll want to conduct research on the organizers and anyone on the RSVP list ahead of time to get a sense of who you can connect with and why
* **Rethink Small Talk.** Most people don't feel comfortable with small talk, but this is how we break the ice in our conversations. Beyond asking people their names and what they think of the free pizza, how can you conduct small *with a purpose?* 

You've come prepared to share your story. How can you also learn about the other person's story in a way that makes them memorable? How can go from simply networking to creating a relationship? 

     Consider:

        * "What are you working on right now?" is a great question to lead with; allows person to answer in a way that speaks to their passions and not just describe their day-to-day
        * Discussing the topic of the event; what was interesting about the talk?
        * Current projects
        * The local tech scene 
        * Tell them about yourself -- this is a *great* time to practice that professional story!!
        
* **Get a business card.** Find a way to follow up the conversation with this person and don't leave without a call to action -- how will you continue the conversation? 

#### Coffee Meetings
Do:

* Ask questions -- ask about experience, projects, what their company does, where they’d work next, what they’d change about their current role/team, advice for getting started in the industry as a new developer
   * "What are you working on?"
* Make eye contact
* Have your story ready to share
* Bring pen + paper, leave computer closed
* Be on-time (preferably early) when you meet
* Offer to buy coffee -- they may buy the coffee themselves, but the offer is a nice touch
* Afterwards, send a thank you message the same day; *Very few people do this, but it means a lot even if it’s really simple*

Don't:

* Ask for a job
* Pretend you're an expert on something you're not. You're there to ask questions and learn more
* Talk about yourself too much
   
#### Social Networking 
There are ways to network without even leaving the comfort of your computer screen! Consider how to connect with others using:

* Use your social media sites (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)
  * Connect: follow people on Twitter, connect on LinkedIn
  * Engage: small talk rules apply here -- don't leave a one-off comment on a thread. Take the time to engage with the thread in a meaningful way. 
* Blogging
* Open Source contributions -- connect with people by showing your work!

### Choose Your Own Adventure: Create a Networking Plan
Spend 10 minutes deciding what networking will look like for you in your job search:

  * Where will you spend your energy?
  
  If you're going to utilize networking events, look at upcoming networking events on meetup.com, builtin.com, or other social networking sites to make a plan for 1 that you can attend between now and the end of Module 3 (this is part of your deliverable). To ensure that it's doable for you, make a plan! Decide:

* Why is this particular event interesting to you? How will you connect with others at this event?
* What kind of value do you hope to gain? What kind of value can you contribute?
* How will you capitalize on these relationships?

  If you'll network using coffee meetings:
  
 * Who do you aim to meet with and why?
 * What kind of value do you hope to gain from the experience? What kind of value can you contribute?
* How will you capitalize on this relationship?
 
 If you'll network mainly using social media or open source contributions
 
 * How will you meet and engage with others (i.e., what projects will you target? What kinds of conversations do you want to engage in?)
 * What kind of value do you hope to gain from the experience? What kind of value can you contribute?
 * How will you capitalize on these online relationships?

### Closing
Whole Group Questions:
* How will these tools be helpful to you in your job search?
* What parts seem most doable? What seems most daunting?
