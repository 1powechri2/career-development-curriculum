### Opening
#### Why
Becoming an effective feedback giver and receiver is all about cultivating self-awareness in communication to understand both what you really want to say to someone about their work processes and understanding what someone else is trying to convey to you. 

Communication is paramount to creating good software. In an agile system, feedback is part of the process, both from users and during sprint retrospectives. Having the skill to give and receive feedback well will make you a strong part of any software team. 

#### Review
Last module, we discussed the 3 types of feedback, triggers that can happen for us when we receive feedback, and the principles of delivering effective feedback, which include being **specific**, **actionable**, and **kind**. And the 3 types of feedback are **appreciation**, **coaching**, and **evaluation**.

Discuss:

* When you submitted your written partner feedback, how many of you were asked to update it before it was sent on to your partner? 
* Without getting into the specifics of that feedback, what was challenging about revising that feedback to make it more specific, actionable, and kind? 

Today, we'll discuss techniques for getting better at giving effective feedback as well as how to provide feedback in a face-to-face conversation. 

#### Objectives
* Utilize a template for a feedback conversation
* Understand what feedback you want to communicate
* 

#### Deliverable

Have a feedback conversation and document it using these [guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md)

### Communicating Feedback in Conversation
Here is a basic template on how to conduct a feedback conversation:
* **Open** the conversation by getting aligned
   * Define the purpose of the conversation
   * What kind of feedback are we discussing?
   * What does the giver want to give me?
   * Is the feedback negotiable or final? A suggestion or a command?
* **Body:** Two-way exchange of information
   * Listening
   * Asserting
   * Managing conversation process
   * Problem-solving
* **Close** by committing to action

Whole Group Debrief:

* What will make this conversation different with a project team vs. having this conversation with just one partner?
* What blind spots might come up in conversation vs. in writing?

### The Body of the Conversation: Refining Your Process 
During this part of the conversation, it's a two-way exchange of information. The feedback giver is communicating their position while the receiver is listening and asserting what they need 


In order to figure out what feedback to give, we need to assess the situation and understand the difference between *positions* and *interests*:

* Positions: what people say they want or demand 
* Interests: underlying needs, desires, fears, and concerns that the stated position should satisfy

Our position is what might come to our mind first:
* Your partner is often late? Your position: Be on time.
* Your partner micromanages? Your position: Stop doing that.

But interests are the *why* behind those positions. *Why* is it a problem that your partner is late? Time ends up being wasted and you may feel disrespected. *Why* is micromanaging not helpful? Because it doesn't allow the other person to have autonomy over their work and could lead to a sense of resentment. 

As the feedback giver, you need to tune into what your underlying interests are in the position you're taking in order to fully help your partner grow and improve.

Three Sources of Interests Behind the Feedback You'll Give:
* Helping your partner
* Helping yourself and your relationship with your partner
* Helping the team/project/cohort

**Examples:**
1. If your source of interest is to *help your partner* and your position is *be on time,* what is the underlying interest to this?

Possible answers:
* Bringing awareness to their behavior: *chronic lateness appears unprofessional and can be seen as a sign of disrespect towards the other person's time*
* Providing your partner with possible solutions to be on time more: *using a calendar, timeboxing, notifications, increasing communication, etc.*
* 

2. If your source of interest is to *help yourself and your relationship with your partner* and your position is *stop m

Possible answers:
* Bringing awareness to

3. If your source of interest is to *help the team/project/cohort* and your position is *

Possible answers:
* Bringing awareness to

Now that we've unpacked the underlying interests behind our positions in feedback, we need to consider how we would phrase the feedback

### Nonviolent Communication Framework
In order to dive into what your feelings/thoughts/concerns/opinions really are in terms of the feedback you need to give, consider the steps to the [Nonviolent Communication Framework](http://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/freeresources/article_archive/heartofnvc_mrosenberg.htm) in order to use our natural *compassion* when communicating with each other.

Similar to the Facts-Feelings-Ask model of having crucial conversations that we discussed in [Learning to Pair](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_one/learning_to_pair.md) in Module One, the Nonviolent Communication Framework asks you to consider how to be more *mindful* in your communication with others.

* **Whole Group:** What does it mean to be mindful in communication? What would that look like? When is communication *not* mindful?

Who is good at mindful communication? No one -- yet. We often spend our time communicating:

 * Blame (i.e. "this is your fault")
 * Insults ( i.e. "you're a jerk")
 * Labels (i.e. "you're not a big picture person")
 * Criticism (i.e. "you're bad at JavaScript")
 * Comparisons (i.e. "no one else in the cohort has this problem")
 * Diagnoses (i.e. you have a hard time thinking problems all the way through") -- Note: this is a big one!

Nonviolent Communication instead integrates:
* Consciousness: empathy and awareness
* Language: to either create connection or distance
* Communication: knowing to how to ask and how to listen
* Means of Influence: shoaring "power" rather than using "power"

NVC Framework follows these steps:

* Observations: Facts without judgments
* Feelings: Harder than it sounds; if you find yourself using "that," "like," or pronouns after the word *feel*, you are not actually saying a feeling
* Needs: You can't figure out what you need until you reflect on your feelings; use positive language and make needs clear
* Requests: Express clearly and ask for a reflection

All of these steps of reflection should take place *before* you have the feedback conversation to clarify your points.

#### Turn & Talk
Find a partner to discuss the following scenarios.

**Scenario #1: "Don't be so quiet"**

Possible alternative: "I'd like to hear you contribute your thoughts more often."

**Scenario #2: "I feel inadequate because when I've brought up ideas you haven't been willing to try any of them out today."**

Possible alternative: We might add "...and I need you to acknowledge my ideas, discuss them with me, and try them sometimes."

**Scenario #3: "I feel you are not giving 100% to this.”**

Possible alternative:  “I feel frustrated that you have not been able to be here this week to work on our project.  Could we agree on times that we can work on this together so that we can both be focused on the same thing?” 

For each of the above, discuss:

* What could be a blind spot here? Tone of voice -- you don’t want to come across as passive aggressive
* How do you feel about these alternatives?
* Would you say anything different to try to realign intent and impact more?





### Putting it into Practice: Having the Conversations
Now is the time to prepare for giving feedback to your project partners in conversations:

* BE: Little Shop (multiple partners)
* FE: Game Time (1 partner)

* 1. **Reflect:** Write down any key points, think about how you can clearly explain your intent, and take into consideration what kind of feedback you need from the other 
* 2. **Schedule the conversation:** 
      When you have the conversation, make sure to follow the Open-Body-Close format for this conversation, and ask clarifying questions. 
* 3. **Plan for follow-up:** This is one conversation on how the project went, but consider any conversations you may want to have after taking time to absorb the feedback

### Final Reflection & Next Steps
As your project wraps, make sure to have any continued or follow-up conversations with your project partners, including a full retro. 

* Reflect in your deliverable using the [template](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/feedback_conversation_reflection_guidelines.md) on at least 1 feedback conversation *(but you should be having conversations each time you work with someone else)*
