# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module Two

### Instructions & Expectations for Structuring the Module
Using the guidelines below, create a plan for your professional development during your Mod 2 repeat based on:

1. Any requirements that you still need to meet 
2. Areas you've identified in which you'd like to grow for your professional and personal development
3. Areas in which you can demonstrate leadership and mentor your fellow cohortmates

In order to fulfill those criteria, you need decide on an option to meet each of the listed deliverables and outline which sessions you will attend and how you plan to participate in order to build your skills in these areas. Please outline your plan in a secret gist, which you'll submit to Allison.
