# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module Two
Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. Mod 2 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Cultivate empathy when working with others
* Building teamwork competencies using agile practices
* Applying personal strengths to a teamwork setting
* Building relationships both with cohortmates and professionals in the industry
* Conduct conversations around feedback
* Use feedback from teammates to improve own practices

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.
