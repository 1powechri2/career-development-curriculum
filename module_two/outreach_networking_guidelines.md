# Outreach & Networking Plan
As we've discussed, meeting people, forming relationships, and having conversations are the key pieces to getting your foot in the door at any company. It's important to be proactive in your approach to outreach and networking, so it's necessary to make a plan for what you'll try to further your networking. 

### Outreach: 
Identify a contact you will reach out to by the end of this module. This could be a mentor, alum, anyone from your current network, or a completely cold contact. Describe:

* Why you want to connect with this person and what you hope to talk about
* When you will contact them by and how you plan to meet
* What your follow-up will look like once you've met with them

### Networking: 
Pick 1 option from those listed below where you will spend your energy and answer the questions: 
  
**Option #1:** If you're going to utilize networking events, look at upcoming networking events on meetup.com, builtin.com, or other social networking sites to make a plan for 1 that you can attend between now and the end of Module 3. Decide:

* Why is this particular event interesting to you? How will you connect with others at this event?
* What kind of value do you hope to gain? What kind of value can you contribute?
* How will you capitalize on these relationships?

**Option #2:** If you'll network using coffee meetings:
  
 * Who do you aim to meet with and why?
 * What kind of value do you hope to gain from the experience? What kind of value can you contribute?
* How will you capitalize on this relationship?
 
**Option #3:** If you'll network mainly using social media or open source contributions:
 
 * How will you meet and engage with others (i.e., what projects will you target? What kinds of conversations do you want to engage in?)
 * What kind of value do you hope to gain from the experience? What kind of value can you contribute?
 * How will you capitalize on these online relationships?
