# Weeks 2 & 3 Professional Development: Guidelines for Module 4 Student Reviews
## Providing Feedback on Resumes, Cover Letters, LinkedIn, Turing Portfolios, GitHub profiles, and Professional Stories

### Internal Review
Students should come prepared with a tailored resume and cover letter for a specific position for which they are interested. They should either bring hard copies of each for all group members or they should share links to both the resume and cover letter in their group Slack channels. Each student will then have 5-10 minutes in the session to discuss their tailored resume and cover letter. They should give a brief overview of the role and the company and then ask for feedback.

**Guiding Questions for Resume Review:**
* How does this resume communicate the skills and story of the student? 
* 


### External Review
During Thursday of Week 3, Module 4 students will undergo an external review with a mentor or potential employer in which they will present 1 of the following:
* Elevator pitch version of their professional story
* Tailored resume
* Tailored cover letter
* LinkedIn profile
* Turing alumni portfolio
* GitHub profile 

#### Expectations for the Reviewer:
Choose 1 of the professional pieces above to ask each student to present -- students should come prepared to present any of them. Please have students each present a different piece for the group in order for them to hear feedback on a variety of professional pieces; you may have more than one student show a specific piece based on group size

Youâ€™ll be with a group of 5-7 students and can break down the 60-minute timeframe in this way:
* 5 minutes for introductions: give a brief overview of your background and career trajectory and students will introduce themselves
* 7-10 minutes for each student: students will present their professional piece and receive your feedback
* Any time remaining could be used for a Q&A

Provide students with specific, actionable, and kind feedback that reflects your experience in the industry -- we want students to get an honest perspective. Here are some guiding questions for you to use when structuring your feedback:
* What stands out to you about this piece? What does it communicate about the student? Does the student present themselves in a unique way? If so, how?
* How clear is the information presented? What questions do you still have?
* What recommendations do you have for improvement?
* Would you consider hiring (or at least continuing the hiring process with) this student based on the information presented?

#### Expectations for students: 
* Come to the meeting prepared for present any of the potential professional pieces
* Stick to their allotted time frame to allow equal feedback time for the whole group
* Ask relevant questions
* Take notes
