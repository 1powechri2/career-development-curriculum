# Weeks 2 & 3 Professional Development: Guidelines for Module 4 Student Reviews
## Providing Feedback on Resumes, Cover Letters, LinkedIn, Turing Portfolios, and Professional Stories

### Internal Review
Each group member will have 5-10 minutes

### External Review

**Prompting Questions:**
* What makes this an effective resume?
* What makes a resume memorable? 
* Consider making a long-form resume that includes as much information as you want. How would you cut it down 1 page for specific positions? What should you always include? What can you leave out?
* How can you ensure that your resume fully represents you?
