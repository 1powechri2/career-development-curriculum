### Kick-Off
You've done the groundwork to prepare for your job search: refining your story, crafting your resume, building your portfolio. Now is the time to put all of these things into motion and talk about why you're the right person for the job. We started some practice on this last mod, and today, we're going to continue that practice in an informal interview workshop.

### Group Practice
Now in your groups, you will get 10 minutes to prep for your responses to the listed questions. Then, your coach will ask each group member one of the listed questions picked at random. Each student will provide their answer, and their group members and coach will provide feedback on the response.

### Debrief
Now that you've had time to practice, go over the feedback you've received to identify one action step you can take away from today's this experience to continue to work on.

* Whole Group Share-out
