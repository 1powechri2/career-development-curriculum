### Kick-Off
You've done the groundwork to prepare for your job search: refining your story, crafting your resume, building your portfolio. Now is the time to put all of these things into motion and talk about why you're the right person for the job. We started some practice on this last mod, and today, we're going to continue that practice in an informal interview workshop.

#### Interview Prep Tips

* Create a doc to keep track of both of technical concepts you're practicing, behavioral answers, and feedback
* Utilize your resources:

  * [Behavioral Interview Prep Resources](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/behavioral_interview_resources.md)
* Practice, practice, practice

#### Bank of Common Questions

 * Question options will include potential to go over professional portfolio pieces

* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a project that failed, a project you had to give up on or a time you worked really hard on a project and it just didnâ€™t pan out as expected. What happened? How did you make the decisions that you made?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?
* Describe your strengths. How have you seen these in practice as a developer?

### Group Practice
Now in your groups, you will get 10 minutes to prep for your responses to the listed questions. Then, your coach will ask each group member one of the listed questions picked at random. Each student will provide their answer, and their group members and coach will provide feedback on the response.

### Debrief
Now that you've had time to practice, go over the feedback you've received to identify one action step you can take away from today's this experience to continue to work on.

* Whole Group Share-out
