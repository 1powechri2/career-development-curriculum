## Opening: The Big Picture
### Find Your Peer Groups Listed on the Slide
You are assigned to a peer group made up of other students and one staff member who will be your coach. You'll meet with your groups every Thursday at 1pm. **You've been grouped according to the timeline by which you said you'd need a job.** Keep this in mind as you plan together.

### Embarking on the Mod 4 Job Search: Dream Big
Close your eyes and imagine that you’re in your dream job; what is it like? What are you doing? What does the company do? Who do you work with? Who are your users? Why is this a dream job for you — do you get to do what you like? Are you using your strengths? Do you get mentorship?

Now open your eyes. Turn & Talk to the person next to you to describe what you imagine and what barriers seem to be in the way of you achieving that dream job. 2-3 groups share out the whole group.

It's important to articulate what you are looking for not just once, but over and over so that you have a clear idea of what you want to be pursuing. And talking about it with your group members will help them hold you accountable to those goals. That's the overall purpose of these groups this module -- to help each other realize our job search goals. 

### Objectives
* Understand the scope and sequence of Module 4 Professional Development and what support looks like this module
* Discover the use and importance of M4 PD peer groups & coaches
* Identify barriers that may come up for you in the job search and utilize strategies to overcome them
* Identify particular resources & strategies for outreach, networking, branding, and interview prep & create next steps

You'll be expected to:

## Individual Planning: Defining Your Module Goals
Go back to the dream job you shared with your partner earlier. Is there anything standing in your way from getting that job? 

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture-based questions)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Balancing the workload of Module 4 and the job search
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

These barriers are another form of Impostor's Syndrome, and they are best counteracted through recognizing your strengths and creating actionable goals.

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on these questions:

* What next steps do you need to take for getting that job you want?
* What strengths can you use to help you in your job search? What do you feel confident in?
* What barriers might you put on yourself in your job search? 
* What kind of support could you use from your peer group and coach to help you move past these barriers? 

Now that you’ve named potential obstacles, you can begin to work past them. Start by thinking back to that dream job and creating concrete goals to get it. Now reflect on these questions:

* What feels doable during this module to move forward in your job search? What would be a stretch?
* Write out 3 SMART goals that you will work towards in your job search this module
	* SMART = Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
* What is 1 action step you will take in the next week to help you make progress towards achieving your goals? 

Be prepared to share these action steps with your group. 

## Professional Development Peer Groups & Coaches
One of the goals of today's session is for you and your group to get to know each other in a way that will create a support system for the rest of the module.

DTR in your groups:

* Introduce yourselves and take this time to say some of your professional story
	* Students: Where are you in the job search currently?
	* Coaches: What are your strengths and areas of expertise to help students?
* [Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to understand group expectations and regular deliverables
	* Coaches: set expectations
	* Students: ask any clarifying questions
	
Share: 
* What are your goals for the module?
* What is one action step you will take in the next week to help you realize your goals?
* How will you hold each other accountable in this group?

Decide as a group how you will help each other and what action steps you're committing to. Post your action steps on your chart paper and start a Slack channel for your group to hold each other accountable.
 
**Whole Group Share-Out:**
Each group will share out what their focuses will be and what action steps they will be taking in their groups to hear how we're holding each other accountable. 

## Work Time: Start on your Action Steps!
