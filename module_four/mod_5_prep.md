# Week 5: 30-Plan Creation & Mod 5 Prep
## Post-Grad Planning Session

Session Timing: 60 mins
* 5 mins: Split up students into groups
* 25 mins: Plan out schedules and map out 30-day plans
* 20 mins: Create goals for what they need to work on 
* 5 mins: Take survey on Mod 5 topics
* 5 mins: Students share out their plans

## Part One
Note for Facilitator: Split the students up into groups based on their comfort level with creating schedules
### Already Organized Group
Have these students:
* Map out the intermission week schedule on the board in Clarke Hall and have them add events/meetups and sessions that they can lead and review with each other during that time
* 

### Not Organized Group
Have these students:
* 

Then during week 1, we’ll hold our first M5 session and know we’ll cover specific session and then weeks 2-5, work on other events that they’ve already been working on

## Part Two
All students make goals for what they need to work on
