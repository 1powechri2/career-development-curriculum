# Week 5: 30-Plan Creation & Mod 5 Prep
## Post-Grad Planning Session

Session Timing: 60 mins
* 5 mins: Split up students into groups
* 25 mins: Plan out schedules and map out 30-day plans
* 20 mins: Create goals for what they need to work on 
* 5 mins: Take survey on Mod 5 topics
* 5 mins: Students share out their plans

## Part One
Note for Facilitator: Split the students up into groups based on their comfort level with creating schedules
### Already Organized Group
Those students should:
* Map out the intermission week schedule on the board in Clarke Hall and have them add events/meetups and sessions that they can lead and review with each other during that time
* Discuss the schedule they're setting up:
  * Coding
  * 
* Lean into your strengths:
  * If you're a routine person, stick to the same routine each day

### Not Organized Group
These students should:
* Find a calendar system that they'll use, such as Google Calendar
* Set up the calendar by creating timeboxes for how to spend their time during the first 4 weeks post-Turing
* Add meetups, Mod 5 sessions (when applicable), Jeff's office hours, self-care time
* Get very specific with how you're spending each chunk of time
  Ex: Update ReadMe for Personal Project
* 

**Micromanaging -- setting up notifications, etc.

## Part Two
All students make goals for what they need to work on during those 30 days, such as:
* Updating ReadMes
* Refactoring projects
*
