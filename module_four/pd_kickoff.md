You'll be expected to:

**You Do:** Students skim over the plan and ask any questions that come up (5 mins) 

## PD Peer Groups: Intros & DTR
Each group member should introduce themselves *using an elevator pitch of their professional story* and share:

* What are your strengths in the job search? What are you doing well?
* What could you use support with from your group members?
* What kind of support can you provide for your group members?

Coaches:
* Introductions
* What are your strengths and areas of expertise to help students?

Additional Resources:
* [Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to understand group expectations and regular deliverables
	* Coaches: set expectations
	* Students: ask any clarifying questions 

## Cover Letter Reviews
Now that you've introduced yourselves, it's time to dive into the cover letters you've brought with you. This cover letter review will take place in your PD groups and follow this format:

* Students: Take 5 minutes to go through the [Cover Letter Checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) and reread the cover letter to decide what feedback will be most valuable during the review. To figure out what feedback will be most valuable for you, think about these questions:
   * What are you not sure about?
   * What would you like to do differently but you don't know how?
* Now going around the group, each person will:
   * Share a brief overview of the company and position for which they're applying; share the link to the position if able
   * Share what kind of feedback they're most interested in
   * Read the cover letter out loud to the group
* Group and Coach will give feedback using these questions:
   * What's your snap impression?
   * What's most memorable?
   * What's repetitive? 
   * What makes this person a good fit for the position?
   * What do you have questions about?
* Each person should get about 7 minutes for their feedback

## PD Peer Groups: Application Strategies
Go around and discuss what next steps for application strategies each person in the group will utilize based on feedback: 

* How will you revise your cover letter?
* Who will you reach out to from the company? Or how will you do research to figure out the right person to reach out to?
* What other next steps do you need to take for this application?

## Closing: Discuss Next Steps & Homework
Next week is Behavioral Interview Prep. Come prepared to answer questions around your story, successes, challenges, working with others, etc. A way to prepare is to practice and brainstorm:

* Your professional story
* An example of a success you've had in programming
* An example of overcoming a challenge in programming
* An example of how you worked well in a team
