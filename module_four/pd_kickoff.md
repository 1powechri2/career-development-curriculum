## Individual Planning: Defining Your Module Goals

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on these questions:

* What are your strengths in the job search? What are you doing well?
* What could you use support with from your group members?
* What kind of support can you provide for your group members?

Additionally, prepare to give your professional story pitch, which is a shortened version of your professional story, to your group to let them know who you are and what your goals are in this job search. 

## Professional Development Peer Groups & Coaches
It's important to communicate your goals and what you need support with during this process as much as possible so that your group can hold you accountable. That's the overall purpose of these groups this module -- to help each other realize our job search goals. 


DTR in your groups:

* Introduce yourselves
	* Students: Give a shortened version of your professional story 
	* Coaches: What are your strengths and areas of expertise to help students?
* [Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to understand group expectations and regular deliverables
	* Coaches: set expectations
	* Students: ask any clarifying questions
	
Share: 
* What are your goals for the module?
* What is one action step you will take in the next week to help you realize your goals?
* How will you hold each other accountable in this group?

Decide as a group how you will help each other and what action steps you're committing to. Post your action steps on your chart paper and start a Slack channel for your group to hold each other accountable.
 
**Whole Group Share-Out:**
Each group will share out what their focuses will be and what action steps they will be taking in their groups to hear how we're holding each other accountable.
