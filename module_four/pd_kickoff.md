DTR in your groups:

	* Coaches: What are your strengths and areas of expertise to help students?

## Visioning, Barriers, & Strengths
### Embarking on the Mod 4 Job Search: Dream Big
Close your eyes and imagine that you’re in your dream job; what is it like? What are you doing? What does the company do? Who do you work with? Who are your users? Why is this a dream job for you — do you get to do what you like? Are you using your strengths? Do you get mentorship?

Now open your eyes. Is there anything standing in your way of achieving that dream? 

### (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture-based questions)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on specific barriers that have come up for you in previous job searches and/or that you anticipate could hold you back in your current job search: 

* Why do you think these barriers occur for you? 
* Have you tried to overcome them in the past? If so, what was effective for you? 
* Think about how you answered the "confidence in the job search" question in the survey for PD peer groups. What specific areas bring you confidence? What areas do you feel less confident in?
* What kind of support could you use from your peer group to help you move past these barriers? 
Be prepared to share this information in your group DTR. 






## Group Discussion
Now with your group, discuss at least one barrier that came to mind in today's exercise and how you hope to overcome it and what support you need from your group to do so.

 Based on goals set in previous exercise, each person comes up with an action step to work on in the next week


### Closing: Discuss Next Steps & Homework
...

Start with a DTR to get on the same page about your job search goals, barriers you might place on yourself in this job search, how you want to communicate with each other, and ideas for how you can motivate and hold each other accountable.
