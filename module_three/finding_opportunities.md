[Slides for this session](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cMJwVIn7QY4txtLLUfGrb-gF1A9PuWxyVfJuSqeKE4U/edit?usp=sharing)

### Why
Now is the point in your Turing education to start on your job search, and through this session, we'll discuss tools to use to approach the job search in an intentional way that will also make the search less overwhelming.  

### Overview of Session
Session length: 60 minutes

* Opening (6 mins)
* Jobtrack.io Tutorial & Set Up (15 mins)
* Discuss Job Searching Tools (20 mins)
* Group Practice: Demo (8 mins)
* You Do: Work Time (10 mins)
* Closing (1 min)

### Opening  
The traditional way to look for jobs isn't necessarily the best route. 

Applying for jobs on sites like monster.com, Indeed, and other career listing sites can be discouraging and ineffective. As little as [20-30% of job listings](http://www.npr.org/2011/02/08/133474431/a-successful-job-search-its-all-about-networking) are being posted online. That means that when you're only looking at company job postings, you are decreasing your chances of finding a job significantly. 

In contrast, [referral candidates](http://www.careerxroads.com/news/SourcesOfHire2013.pdf) are 3-4 times more likely to be hired than non-referral candidates. To add yourself to those numbers, today we'll talk about how to find a job without relying on your resume or job postings.

#### Turn & Talk
At the end of last mod, you were asked to create a networking and outreach plan to execute during this mod. The goal of this plan was to start your job search by creating connections. Turn and talk to provide your partner with an update on this plan:

* What connections have you created?
* What would you like to improve in your networking and outreach plans?
* How can you help hold each other accountable? 

A few groups will share out. 

#### Objectives

* Pivot job search priorities to focus on finding people and companies you're interested in
* Create and effectively use a [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io/) account for your job search
* Discuss how to use tools such as Meetup, LinkedIn, BuiltIn, and other sites to find opportunities
* Redefine how to use job boards or job listings to capitalize on opportunities
* Begin research on companies and jobs to jumpstart your job search

### Prep for Your Job Search: Using Jobtrack.io
The first step to a successful job search is to utilize a tracking system, which we'll set up today with [jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io/). Having this system to keep track of everything from companies you're interested in to notes from coffee meetings will be highly beneficial in helping you stay organized in the job search. In order to successfully pass your Module 4 portfolio, you'll need to discuss how you're using Jobtrack in your portfolio review in your PD deliverable, found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md). 

[Jobtrack.io](https://jobtrack.io) was built specifically for job seekers. It allows you to track relationships with companies and where you are in the process, pulling in data about companies intuitively through its free Chrome extension. You are also able to manage versions of your resume and cover letters within the tool, and it will send you reminders to proceed in different steps of the process with companies. 

Let's walk through how to set up and use Jobtrack. 

**Tips:**

* Add the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/jobtrack.io)
* Watch this [tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14SPY5CbL5hQj7JDxGrAnCMSkIgmLG78n/view?usp=sharing) to get even more information on how to use Jobtrack.io effectively

#### Your Turn
Take 5 minutes to set up your Jobtrack account and install the chrome extension. We'll come back to logging in more information later in the session. 

### Your Job Search Tool Box: 
Let's start with these tools: 

* [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/)
   * Tips: Search for groups local to the area you’re interested in working and in topics that you're interested in pursuing (i.e. Ruby, JavaScript, etc.). Be sure to select "Groups" (not "Calendar"). On the group page, there are two things that will be very useful to your job search:
      * Organizers list: who are they? Where do they work? What other meetups are they active in?
      * Upcoming events: look at the RSVP list; Who else is going? What companies do they work for? 
* [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/)
   * Tips: 
      * Use the "Advanced Search" tool to find people based on skillset, location, and industry OR names of companies and select the "People who work at..." option
      * In "Keywords" type in the skills or focus you want to be working in (i.e., JavaScript, Ruby, Python, EdTech, FinTech, etc.)
      * In "Location" type in the area where you'd like to work
      * In "Industry" select "computer software"
      * Search: Of those profiles that return, look at their profiles to see the list of companies they've worked for throughout their experience. What companies do you want to continue to research? Who do you want to connect with? 
      * You can also click on the company’s page and on the right side, view "Similar Companies" where your connections work
* [Google](http://www.google.com/)
    * Tips:  
      * Search “top tech companies in [location]” / "top workplaces in [industry (edtech, fintech, etc.)]" and look for a journalist-generated list of companies that are recommended in that area
      * Pick a couple companies to look into and walk through their website, including their careers page and team page
      * Research these people on LinkedIn, Twitter, and look for a personal blog

#### Social Media Resources for your Job Search:

* [5 Better Ways to Network on Twitter and LinkedIn](https://www.themuse.com/advice/5-better-ways-to-network-on-twitter-linkedin)

**Whole Group:** How can you use these sites to find opportunities? How could you dig deeper beyond a job listing?

#### You Do: Group Time
In small groups of 3-4 students, using one of the sites discussed, find at least one job that each person in the group is interested in. You'll present to the whole group:

* Where you found the job and how
* What details you uncovered in your research
* What steps you will take to apply

### Group Practice: You Found a Job Listing, Now What?
Now that we have some job listings, we need to dig deeper. Remember, if we really want these jobs, we need to create connections with the people and the companies behind the job listings so we can become referral candidates. 

Using this job listing, I'm going to update my Jobtrack and create a plan for outreach using the guidelines we discussed last module in the [Outreach & Networking Session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_two/outreach_and_networking.md):

* Update my contacts -- how do I find contact information?
* Craft my email -- what should I say? 
* Create a task/Set up a meeting

Need more help? Join the #cold-outreach channel and come to their sessions

**What else?**

* Create a tailored resume for the position
* Write a tailored cover letter for the position
* Research the technologies/libraries the company uses to use in an upcoming project

### Your Turn: Conduct Research & Update Your Jobtrack.io Account
You have 10 minutes now to get started researching and adding opportunities you're interested in to your Jobtrack.io account.

### Closing & Next Steps
It's important to take the time now to organize your job search. Take these steps to make this process less daunting and empower yourself. 

Next week, you'll be going on Job Shadowing. We know that this is *not* a job interview, but it is an opportunity to create connections with others in the industry. Add contact information and other info to your Jobtrack from your Job Shadowing experience.
