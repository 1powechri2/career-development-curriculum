# PD & Gear Up Plan for Repeating Module Three
Repeating the module is an opportunity to not only solidify technical skills but also take advantage of extra time to work on your professional development and take concrete steps for your job search. Mod 3 professional development is focused on these areas:

* Discover and describe how previous jobs, skills, and experiences contribute to new career path
* Utilize strategies for finding opportunities in the tech community
* Articulate and apply strengths to professional situations
* Describe strategies for successful interviews
* Present professional story through projects, resume, and Turing portfolio
* Actively participate in the tech community

As you make your plan here, think about how you can push yourself to grow in these areas further.

Here's the breakdown of expectations for repeating the module:
