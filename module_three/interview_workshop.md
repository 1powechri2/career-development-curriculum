### Opening
How prepared do you feel for the job search? 

In this session, you'll focus on combining all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) and in previous modules to help you answer common interview questions. 

### Objectives
* Practice answering common culture interview questions
* Provide effective feedback for each other on responses
* Put feedback into practice
* Come away from this session with a clear plan on how to improve your interview process

### Deliverables
* Complete your resume edits
* Complete your Turing portfolio
* Complete PD Peer Groups Survey

#### Modeling the Process
How would you answer one of the following questions?

* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a successful idea or project you worked on. What are some of the challenges you had to overcome? What made it a success?
* Describe a project that failed, a project you had to give up on or a time you worked really hard on a project and it just didn’t pan out as expected. What happened? How did you make the decisions that you made?
* What is your approach to working on a team?
* What is an area of growth for you?
* Describe your strengths. How have you seen these in practice as a developer?

What have you learned about yourself that you can pull from in these answers?

* Discuss StrengthsFinder -- how do these results play out for you in teams? How do they describe you?
* Connect to feedback you’ve gotten from partners -- how have you used this feedback to grow?
* Connect to prior experience / values / reflections


Find a partner or group of 3 to work through questions of your choice *(you don't have to work on the same question as your partner).* 

### Question #1 Prep
**You Do:** Take 5 minutes to write or think through your answer to one of the questions

### Whole Group Debrief
* What are your takeaways from this practice?
* What will you focus on in your continued interview prep?
* What do you need support on in Mod 4?

### Prep for Mod 4
Using the practice from today, think about your job search that starts next mod, and fill out the survey for Module 4 PD Peer Groups.

### Closing
Create a plan to get your resume and Turing portfolio finished by next week's portfolio review. 

As you finish up Module 3, come back to these questions that we posed at the beginning of the session. Assess how confident you feel to answer any of these as you keep going with your job search:
* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a time when you've failed; what happened and how did you manage that failure?
* What is your approach to working on a team? 
* How would you describe yourself? 
* What is an area of growth for you? 
* What are your strengths and how have you seen them in practice?
