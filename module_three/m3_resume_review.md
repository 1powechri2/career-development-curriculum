# Module Three Resume Review Guidelines

### Session Overview
Length: 90 mins

* Kick-off in Clarke Hall: Overview, reminders about job shadowing (5 mins)
* Transition to locations (5 mins)
* Workshop (40 mins)
* Revisions & Submit final draft (40 mins)

## Job Shadow Reminders
Remind students about job shadowing, including professional expectations, such as:
* Keep your phones off/out of reach 
* Don't drink alcohol prior to the shadow
* Dress professionally -- doesn't need to be overly dressy, focus on business casual
* Come prepared with questions

Read this feedback we've gotten from an alum at Ibotta to your students: 
```As a Turing grad who benefitted greatly from shadowing, it's a pleasure to be able to hopefully provide the same benefit to Turing students who shadow me at Ibotta. I have a bit of feedback for future shadowing students: It's best not to consume anything before the shadowing that might cause one's breath to smell like alcohol. If it's not alcohol, then sometimes chewing tobacco can cause this odor. When you're sitting right next to someone you're shadowing, they will smell it. So that's something Turing students might want to be aware of before they shadow. Another thing is that it's best not to check your phone while the person you're shadowing is trying to show you things. It's rude and shows that you're unengaged during time that the person has taken out of their day to hopefully show you useful stuff. Another thing I'd recommend is for students to come prepared with questions. This is a rare opportunity to learn what life is like outside of Turing, and it's a shame to not take advantage of it. Respectfully asking questions also evidences engagement and interest on the part of the student. I am so glad that Turing offers its students this opportunity, and it was something that I found really useful. I hope this feedback isn't too heavy-handed. Just something I wanted to share with you. Thanks for all that you do, and I hope to get to meet you in person some day soon!```

## Workshop Overview
Each student should have 10 minutes for their workshop. Go around the group for quick intros and decide who will go first. The student who is presenting should come prepared to:

* Share elevator pitch of their professional story for feedback (about 2 mins)
* Plug into a monitor to show their resume to the group. They may also choose to bring hard copies

Each person in the group should provide 1 piece of appreciative feedback and 1 piece of coaching feedback for both the professional story and the resume 

### For Coaches: What to Look for in a Professional Story
Students have been asked to describe themselves using these 3 guiding questions:
* Who are you?
* Why are you here in this industry?
* Where do you want to go in this industry?

Feedback should include:
* **Appreciation** on what is compelling about the story
* **Coaching** on anything that isn't clear or what could be improved in the storytelling skills area 
* Principles of being specific, actionable, and kind 

### For Coaches: What to Look for in a Resume
Students were given these guidelines for creating an effective resume:
* **Professional story** at the top; About 3-4 sentences about their transition into software development. Look for:
 	* Who are they: As a software developer? Team member? Career changer? Individual?
 	* How they got here: Why software development? Why Turing? Why now?
 	* Whatâ€™s Next: What do they hope to accomplish? What are they looking to gain from this experience? 
* Followed by **skills**:
  * Listing of languages, frameworks, testing, and tool. Transferable skills should be in this section as well
* Followed by **projects**: Highlighting 2-3 favorite projects; Some things to look for:
	 * What does your application do? What problem does it solve? 
	 * Who is it built for? What does it allow the user to do? 
 	* What is the high level overview of the project? 
 	* What technologies did you use? Highlighting API's, frameworks, and languages
 	* In what period of time was it built?
 	* What was their role in the project?
  * Clickable GitHub repo and any applicable links
* Followed by **experience:**
  * Titled as "Experience" rather than "Employment"
	 * Format should start with title followed by company
	 * Dates should be used
	 * Bullet points (3-5 per organization) should be used & focused on the value that was brought to the organization rather than the individual tasks performed
	* Turing can fall under experience or education 
* Followed by **education (if applicable)**

Check for:
  * Layout -- is it easily readable? Is it interesting/eye-catching?
  * Organization -- can you tell clearly what the sections are telling you?
  * Communication skills -- are there typos? Is the punctuation correct? 

**Prompting Questions:**
* What makes this an effective resume?
* What is memorable about this student? 
* Do you have a clear sense of what kind of work the student has produced?
* Does the resume give a sense of the student's career trajectory? How would you describe the student based on the resume?
* Is Turing listed on the resume?
* Are technical skills and projects near the top of the resume? Is the layout clean and interesting to look at?

## Revision Time
Students should use the remaining 40 minutes to revise their resumes and submit them to their pre-assigned staff member for final review.
