### Directions for Students
In order to come to Resume Review, students need to use **[this checklist](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/resume_review_checklist.md)** to confirm they have met expectations for their resume

### Directions for Reviewers
#### Structure for the Review:
Length: 60-70 mins

* Kick-off in Clarke Hall: Overview and find groups (5 mins)
* Transition to locations (5 mins)
* Workshop (50-60 mins)
	* Each student should have 10 minutes for their workshop. The student who is presenting should come prepared to plug into a monitor or bring hard copies of the resume along with their checklist. 

#### Discussion Points
For the resume review, students will bring their resume and their review checklist with them. They should have already reviewed their resume with the checklist. You'll use their checklist to complete the review and choose some of the following questions to discuss in order to provide more in-depth feedback:

Overall:
* What is effective/stands out to you about this resume? 
* If this resume crossed your desk, what would stick with you about this person?
* Is the layout clean and interesting to look at?
* Are there typos? Is the punctuation correct? 

Professional Summary:
* What do you know about the student from the professional summary? 
* How would you describe the student based on the resume?
* What questions do you still have about who this person is?

Projects/Skills:
* If you had no context of Turing projects, do the descriptions provide a clear understanding of the project?
	* Who is the project built for? What can the user do?
	* What problem does the app solve?
	* Is it clear what technologies were used?
	* How long did the project take to build?
* If you were going to interview this student, what questions would you ask about the projects?
* GitHub links: are they to the student's own repo? Are ReadMes created?
* For technical skills, are they grouped in a logical way? 

Feedback should include:
* **Appreciation** on what is compelling about the story
* **Coaching** on anything that isn't clear or what could be improved in the storytelling skills area 
* Principles of being specific, actionable, and kind 

**Students in the group should also participate in providing feedback.**
