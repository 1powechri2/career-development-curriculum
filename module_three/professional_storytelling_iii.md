### Professional Development in Module Three
This is the first of your PD sessions this module. Module Three is the module in which the personal and professional development of the previous two modules is applied to job searching and discovering the right path for your new career. You'll leave Module Three with a clear blueprint for your job search, and we'll start by focusing in on what it is that you want out of your new career, building on your professional story, and reflecting on how your strengths apply to finding this new, fulfilling career path.

### Objectives
* Build on your professional story by focusing on "what's next"
* Create a resume, cover letter, and Turing portfolio that reflect your skills and your professional story

### Deliverables
* You'll need a draft of your resume ready by Week 3 for review from staff coaches
* You'll submit your revised draft of your resume to the Career Development Team (Allison, Ellen Mary, or Kayt) by the end of Week 3
* You'll need to have your [Turing portfolio](https://www.turing.io/alumni) finished and published on the Turing website by Monday of Week 6 with your final draft of your resume uploaded 

### Opening
Last module, you created a draft of your professional story, and this module, you'll continue to refine it through your resume, cover letters, and your Turing portfolio. You'll also want to update your LinkedIn profiles. 

The aim of today's session is to provide you with the necessary tools to tell your story as a professional developer in your job search. 

### Recap: Telling Your Story
As we've discussed, our lives are made up of stories -- they are how we make sense of our experiences. Stories define who we are. The same is true with your professional story. Telling the story of your professional transition into software development helps others understand your motives, character, and capacity to reach the goals that you've set for yourself. In short, your story makes others believe in you.

These three questions are the basis of telling your story:  

* **Who are you?** *(as a developer, a teammate, a worker, a career changer)*
* **Why are you here?** *(Why software development? Why now? Consider both your background but also what drives you to be in this field)*
* **What's next?** *(Where do you see yourself going in this career?)* 

#### You Do: Lightning Rounds of Storytelling
Using your professional story draft that you completed at the end of Module Two, review it for 2 minutes and then pair up with a partner to share a brief version of your professional story, including what's next for you in this career. Each person will get 1.5 minutes to share their stories and then switch. We will do 3 rounds of this practice total, so you'll have 3 different partners to practice with. 

### Resumes 
Now that you've fleshed out your story into an easily told format, let's focus on the different ways you can convey your story. One of them is through your resume. As a junior developer, your resume might look very different from its previous forms. Here are some things to keep in mind:

* Reorganize your resume to lead with technical skills and coding projects
* Analyze what experiences are most useful in demonstrating transferable and applicable skills for an entry level tech role
* Produce a resume with clear and concise language aligned with current tech industry standards

#### Research: Turn & Talk
With a partner, take a look at 2-3 examples from past Turing alumni. What do you notice about these resumes? What sticks out to you? What would you do differently? You'll have 6 minutes to discuss with your partner.

**Whole Group Debrief:**

* What are your takeaways from these resume examples? 

#### Layouts
You can choose to set up a traditional resume use a template like this [traditional resume](http://visualcv.com/www/google-docs-resume-templates/), but you may want to personalize the style with a layout. Check out these sites for building a resume:

* [Creddle](http://creddle.io/)
* [Enhancv](https://enhancv.com/)

* [Standard Resume](https://standardresume.co/)
* [Kick Resume](https://www.kickresume.com/)
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
* Find even more sites [here](https://www.producthunt.com/e/create-a-beautiful-resume)

#### Content Inclusion - Follow this order
* **Header:**
	* Name, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be linked text, not the long URL strings)
	* Remove location
	* Include title (Software Developer)

* **Summary:** Summary should be 3-4 sentences about your journey into software developer. Tell the reader:
	* Who you are: As a software developer? Team member? Career changer? Individual?
	* How you got here: Why software development? Why Turing? Why now?
	* What’s Next: What do you hope to accomplish? What are you looking to gain from this experience? Is there a particular industry/tech stack/project you would like to be working with?

* **Skills:** Continue to add to this area outlining your technical specialties (languages, frameworks, testing and tools). Ideally you want 12-20 items by the end of the program. 
	* Highlight your dev/technical skills here. Include any transferable and/or professional skills in the experience section (see below).

* **Projects:** Follow skills with a project section that includes 2-3 of your favorite projects. What are you proud of? Show it off! Provide a 1-2 sentence overview of the project. Consider answering these questions:
	* What does your application do? What problem does it solve? 
	* Who is it built for? What does it allow the user to do? 
	* What technologies did you use? Dive into what API's, frameworks and languages you incorporated.
	* In what period of time was it built? This helps set folks' expectations appropriately. A product built in two months should look a lot more polished than one built in two weeks.
	* If you worked in a group, what was your role in the project?

* Include both a clickable link to your project repo and to the launched application. The repo should include a ReadMe. If the project lives on a partner's GitHub, make sure to clone down your own version and include that link instead. 

* **Experience:** Follow Projects with Experience
	* Title as "Experience" rather than "Employment"
	* Format should start with title followed by company
	* Use dates
	* Use bullet points (3-5 per organization) & focus on the value that you brought to the organization rather than the individual tasks performed. This is a perfect place to discuss other skills you have that you've utilized in adding value to the company. Answer the questions: _What did you accomplish in this position?_ or _What are you most proud of?_ rather than, *What were your boring day-to-day duties?*
	* Turing can fall under experience or education but having it fall under experience brings it closer to the top and ties in with your self identification as a software developer. *Titling this category as “experience” rather than work history/employment allows for it to include things aside from paid employment*

* Education
	* Remove dates. List in reverse chronological order, from the most recent to the least recent
	* Remove GPAs

As you update your resume, check on what updates you need to make to your LinkedIn -- update this profile as often as necessary to ensure it reflects exactly what you want it to portray.

#### Next Steps: Create Your Master Resume
You'll want to tailor your resume for any position you apply for, but it's helpful to have a master longform copy to use as your foundation whenever tailoring a resume. This master copy can be longer than a page as it should contain everything you might want to put on a resume -- don't leave anything out. Later, when you need to tailor your resume to a specific position, you can make a copy of it to cut down to one page. 

Take 10 minutes to explore some different tools and get your master resume draft started. 

### Cover Letters
Cover letters are a perfect way to tell your story when you're applying for a job. 

#### Layout
Keep your cover letters to 1 page. 2-3 paragraphs is standard. Here is a template for how you can lay out a cover letter:

* Here are some suggested ways to structure the letter:
  * Paragraph #1: Introduce yourself -- *briefly.*
      * Explain why you are applying for the position and include some research into the company
      * Give a brief version of your professional story; why does this company and this position specifically fit into your next step in your career?
      * Consider including a **hook** to connect to the reader and give a sense of your personality
      * If you have any connection at the company, mention them here
  * Paragraph #2: Highlight your skills specific to the job posting
      * This is *not* a rehashing of your resume. Rather, what do you want the reader to notice about your resume? What extra detail can you provide here?
      * Go more in-depth about a certain project or discuss an example of how you've done similar work to what the company is looking for
  * Paragraph #3: Connect the first two paragraphs by talking about how you are the best fit to build *value* for the company
      * This letter is about helping the company see how you uniquely will help them meet their goals. Paint that picture for them. Emphasize how you will not only flourish in this role but you also have the drive and ability to keep growing professionally, take on more responsibility, and benefit the company in ways beyond the initial position for which you're applying.
      * How can you apply your background and skills to make great experiences for the company's users/customers? What can you leave them with that will make them want to contact you?
      * Include information about your availability for interviews and/or references if applicable
      
Check out this example to see how professional stories can be told through a cover letter:

* [Tommasina Miller Example](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/files/Example%20Cover%20Letter.pdf)

**Whole Group Discussion:**

* What stood out to you about this example?
* What story is the author telling?

**Other Key Points for Cover Letters:**

* Don’t talk about what you’re hoping to get from the company (i.e., mentorship, culture, etc.). The letter should be all about what you’re going to give the company as an employee, not take from their business — mentorship and culture will happen *anyway*, and not mentioning it will make you stand out
* Interested in a specific company? Consider how to use their tools or libraries in your projects at Turing. When writing your cover letter to them, mention those in the 2nd paragraph of the cover letter. You’ll look like a great candidate if you’re already familiar with the company's tools/libraries. You should also consider how to interact with the company's employees through Pull Requests or GitHub issues.

#### Cover Letter Practice: Establishing a Template
Draft out a master template for your cover letter using the 3-paragraph format above. You'll tailor this to particular positions, but you can start thinking through right now what kind of hook you could utilize in the first paragraph to draw in a reader. Use experience from your storytelling practice:

* What brought you to software development?
* What makes you interesting and unique from your background and/or specific passions?
* Where do you want to go? 

Once you have a hook and a template established, it'll be much easier to craft a compelling and tailored cover letter each time you need one. 

### Turing Portfolio
As you fill out your [Turing portfolio](https://www.turing.io/alumni), think about how you want to present yourself. 

Here are the must haves:
* Professional photo
* Description -- *how can you tell your story here?*
* 1 project -- in M4, keep in mind that you'll need to include 3 projects

Check out some examples of how others have created their [portfolios](https://www.turing.io/alumni).

### Closing
Find another person in the room to introduce yourself in a few sentences using the new story you've been developing. The more you practice telling your story, the better you'll get. 

#### Looking Ahead
Your next PD session is on the [Flower Exercise](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/flower_exercise.md) from the book *What Color is Your Parachute?* This exercise is all about diving into different aspects of your character, goals, and values to more fully understand what you're looking for in this new career.
