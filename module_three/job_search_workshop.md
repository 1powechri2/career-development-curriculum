### Opening
Why are you interested in this career? Describe a time when you've failed; what happened and how did you manage that failure? What is your approach to working on a team? How would you describe yourself? What is an area of growth for you? What are your strengths and how have you seen them in practice?

In this session, you'll focus on combining all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) and in previous modules to help you answer these questions one by one.
