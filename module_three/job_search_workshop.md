### Opening
Why do you want to be a software developer? Describe a time when you've failed; what happened and how did you manage that failure? What is your approach to working on a team? How would you describe yourself? What is an area of growth for you? What are your strengths and how have you seen them in practice?

In this session, you'll focus on combining all the professional development pieces you've worked on this module (your resume, your professional story, your flower exercise, your research, your job shadowing experience) and in previous modules to help you answer these questions one by one.

### Objectives
* Practice answering common culture interview questions
* Provide effective feedback for each other on responses
* Put feedback into practice
* Come away from this session with a clear plan on how to improve your interview process

### Deliverables
* Complete your resume edits
* Complete your Turing portfolio
* Complete PD Peer Groups Survey

#### Modeling the Process
What have you learned about yourself that you can pull from in these answers?

* Discuss StrengthsFinder -- how do these results play out for you in teams? How do they describe you?
* Connect to feedback you’ve gotten from partners -- how have you used this feedback to grow?
* Connect to prior experience / values / reflections

### Stations
Directions:
* Pick 3 of the following questions to focus on today
* You’ll have 15 mins at each station:
  * 5 mins of prep
  * 3 mins to answer question x2 
  * 1 min of feedback from partner x2
  * 1 min to put feedback into practice x2

### Whole Group Debrief
* What are your takeaways from this practice?
* What will you focus on in your continued interview prep?
* What do you need support on in Mod 4?

### Prep for Mod 4
Using the practice from today, think about your job search that starts next mod, and fill out the survey for Module 4 PD Peer Groups.

### Closing
Create a plan to get your resume and Turing portfolio finished by next week's portfolio review. 

As you finish up Module 3, come back to these questions that we posed at the beginning of the session. Assess how confident you feel to answer any of these as you keep going with your job search:
* Why do you want to be a software developer?
* Describe a time when you've failed; what happened and how did you manage that failure?
* What is your approach to working on a team? 
* How would you describe yourself? 
* What is an area of growth for you? 
* What are your strengths and how have you seen them in practice?
