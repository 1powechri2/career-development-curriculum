### Do's & Don't's of a Cover Letter
**Hook:** When you talk to someone that you want to be friends with, what kind of information do you share about yourself? What kind of impression do you want them to have? Your cover letter should provide that same impression. 

discuss what should and should not go in a cover letter, look at templates for layouts, answer general questions


### We Do
As a whole group, we'll find a job posting and write a cover letter together. 

### Workshop Time
Participants write a cover letter for the job posting that they brought with them to the session. 

### Round of Feedback
Each participant will get 5 minutes to spend on their cover letter to get feedback from the group. Feedback should be **specific, actionable, and kind** and include both **appreciation and coaching.** 

For larger groups, participants can be broken up in smaller groups, with a max of 8 people per group.

### Revision Time
Use the next 10 minutes to revise your cover letter according to feedback you received and then send in your application.

### Closing
Debrief as a whole group:

* What are you taking away from today's session?
