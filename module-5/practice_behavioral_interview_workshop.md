# Practice Behavioral Interview Workshop

[Slides?

### Opening
These are a few of the BIG Present 3 questions (focus on big ones: tell me about yourself, why are you interested in this company/job, etc.), have students prep


### Review
Let's go over some interview techniques that we [first discussed in Module Three's session](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/interview_workshop.md). The acronym STAR is a helpful way to break down an answer for most interview questions:

* **Situation:** The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation in which you found yourself.
* **Task:** What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use “Target” rather than “Task”. Job interview candidates who describe a “Target” they set themselves instead of an externally imposed “Task” emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance.
* **Action:** What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were.
* **Results:** What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and did you meet your objectives? What did you learn from this experience and have you used this learning since?

Whole Group:
* What can this look like in practice? Let's look at some examples.
* How could you use STAR to help you prep for interviews?
* With what kinds of questions would STAR *not* be an effective framework?

### Model
Using these questions, facilitators model answering the questions effectively and break down the answers in a Q&A with students:

* 

Students can also go back to their notes and make revisions to their initial prep notes.

### Practice

Then practice on those same questions

### Remaining Time
Time for more questions at the end; could invite people to be in the middle as fishbowl, whoever’s feeling brave

### Closing
Recap STAR method, how students can prep for these interviews, and any remaining questions.
